Here is a document of links pointing to FDA guidance documents and other forms of communication. It was mostly compiled by googling CDRH regulatory buzz words. We hope this document is useful. Caveat to all: You won’t know what’s required for your submission until you ask.

## Pre-submission meeting

In CDRH, the best advice is to know about pre-submission meetings.

*  [Slides: Pre-Submissions and Meetings with FDA Staff.](https://www.fda.gov/media/93740/download)

*  [Guidance document: Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff.](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program)


## IFU: Indications for Use

Part of the definition of your medical device are the indications for use.

*  [Webpage: Indications For Use.](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/generalspecific-intended-use-guidance-industry)

It’s never to early to start thinking about, researching, and crafting an IFU for your device.

## Comprehensive Regulatory Assistance

*  [Webpage: Comprehensive Regulatory Assistance.](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance)


## 510k program

* [Guidance Document: The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications 510(k). Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/510k-program-evaluating-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k)

A Premarket Notification, also known as a 510(k), is a submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is safe and effective by proving substantial equivalence (SE) to a legally marketed device (predicate device).

## de Novos

*  Special controls accompany all de Novo classifications.

*  Special controls outline submission requirements for medical devices with similar IFU.

*  Special controls are defined for a device type that can be broad or narrow.

*  [Webpage: Special Controls.](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/overview-device-regulation/regulatory-controls#special)

If you can’t find a de Novo or existing 510k that is a perfect predicate for your device type: Then find and learn about the closest one or two. It’s a way to start.

## PMA

Pursuing a pre-market authorization **(PMA)** is a regulatory pathway for medical devices that have a higher risk profile than a 510(k). PMAs are not covered here.

## Mock Submission

*  [Webpage: MDICx webinar that includes a presentation on mock submissions to FDA/CDRH.](https://mdic.org/event/computational-modeling-simulation/)

*  [Slides: Mock Submissions to FDA/CDRH: History and Lessons Learned](./process-guides/pdfs-images/20190412-HTTMockSubmissions.pdf) by Kyle Myers, Director DIDSR/OSEL/CDRH/FDA. This presentation was made as the agency was working with MDIC to pursue a mock submission about, “Augmenting a Clinical Study with Virtual Patient Models.”

    *  The mock submission was followed quickly by actual submissions.

    *  [Virtual Patient Page at MDIC.](https://mdic.org/project/virtual-patient-vp-model/)

*  The virtual patients mock submission was preceded by [“Protein-Based Multiplex Assays: Mock Presubmissions to the US Food and Drug Administration”](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/56/2/165/5622492?login=true) , Regnier et al.

## Medical Device Development Tools (MDDT) program

The FDA’s Medical Device Development Tools (MDDT) program is a way for the FDA to qualify tools that medical device sponsors can use in the development and evaluation of medical devices. It is a way for the broader community (academia, health providers, and government scientists, not just industry) can impact the regulatory process.

## Computer Aided Detection and Diagnosis: CADe, CADx

*  [Guidance document: Software as a medical device.](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/software-medical-device-samd-clinical-evaluation)

*  Computer added detection (CADe) guidance – Radiology

    *  [Guidance document: Non-clinical = Stand-alone = No human in the loop.](https://www.fda.gov/media/154994/download)

    *  [Guidance document: Clinical = Reader Study = Human in the loop.](https://www.fda.gov/media/77642/download)
