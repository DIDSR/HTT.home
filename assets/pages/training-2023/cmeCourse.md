# Mirror of CME Course

## Description 
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have been established as a prognostic biomarker in early-stage triple negative breast cancer. The assessment of the density of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes at the time of diagnosis may improve the accuracy of prognosis determination and inform therapeutic decision-making.

## Learning Objectives 
After completing the module, the participant should be able to:

* Describe the significance of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in triple negative breast cancer. 

* Demonstrate knowledge of the approach to determining the density of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.  

## Target Audience 
Physicians

## Course Content (3.00 CME credits)

1. Introduction to stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes *(12min presentation)*

   * We discuss the immune systems' role in mediating tumor progression, and the statistics and literature that demonstrate how sTILs are prognostic biomarkers for patient outcomes and response to therapy in certain types of breast cancer.  
    
   * [Watch the video here.](https://vimeo.com/800001397)  

1. TILs Education: What are TILs and their Assessment *(8min tutorial video)*

    * Video description of the steps of the sTILs assessment.  
    
    * Presented by the International TILs Working Group: [Video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPa-pXIBBlU)  

1. Pitfalls in the sTILs Assessment *(27min presentation)*
