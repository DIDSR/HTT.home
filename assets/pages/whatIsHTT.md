title: What is HTT?
---

# Our Goal
The goal of the High-Throughput Truthing (HTT) project is to produce a **validation dataset** established by pathologist annotations for artificial intelligence algorithms analyzing digital scans of pathology slides: data (images + annotations). We are pursuing the qualification of the final validation dataset as an FDA-qualified medical device development tool [MDDT](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-development-tools-mddt) to become a high-value public resource that can be used in AI/ML algorithm submissions and guide others to develop quality validation datasets. 
 
 * Here is a project overview: [Dudgeon2021_J-Pathol-Inform_v12p45](https://www.doi.org/10.4103/jpi.jpi_83_20).
 * Other selected works from this project can be found on our [Publications Page](publications.md).

# Why is the FDA Doing This? 
Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce pathologist burden searching and evaluating cells and features on the slides; let the computer do it. AI also promises to help the pathologists be more quantitative and less variable. The regulatory question is then, *“How well can the computer algorithms do the tasks?”* The most practical ground truth for evaluating algorithm performance is pathologist interpretations of the whole slide images. 

The problem is that pathologist interpretations can vary greatly between and within pathologists. Therefore, we need to acknowledge this variability, reduce this variability, and then account for this variability. Tools, methods, and research in this area are lacking, so we are doing it. 

In this work, we collect data that demonstrates pathologist variability, we create training materials to reduce pathologist variability, and we develop methods to investigate and account for pathologist variability.
