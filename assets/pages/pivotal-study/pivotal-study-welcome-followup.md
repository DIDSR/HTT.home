Hello,

I hope you are having a wonderful week.  I wanted to follow up regarding your account registration on the CaMicroscope platform.  Are you having any issues completing the CME course? 
As a reminder, information on how to begin the CME course is available for your reference [here](/../training-2023.md).  Please let us know if you run into any issues.  Once you have completed the course, please email your completion certificate to us.  

Further, as we are still recruiting participants for this study, I am hoping you can share with us how you learned about the CaMicroscope platform and the High Throughput Truthing Project? 

Below is a flyer about the Project and how to get involved for you to share with any colleagues interested in the digital pathology or dataset curation spaces.  
And finally as a reminder, if you have any questions about the HTT Project or next steps, feel free to consult our Project website, or send us an email directly.   

We are looking forward to hearing from and working with you,

[The project managers](/../team.md)
