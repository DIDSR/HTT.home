## Overview

We have launched the HTT pivotal study June 2023. It was a soft launch with friendly pathologists beta testing the platform to uncover issues. In September 2023, we are comfortable and confident with the platform and are broadly recruiting pathologists. We are still sourcing slides and images and are looking to source slides from a third site. If you can help with this, please [contact the project organizers](https://didsr.github.io/HTT.home/assets/pages/team). We will use this page to provide progress updates, steps to participate, and recruiting materials.

## Steps to Participate

Thank you for your interest in the HTT pivotal study. We are **recruiting volunteers** to provide annotations of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) that will be used for validating artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Currently, due to regulatory expectations, we are requiring participants to be board-certified U.S. pathologists or international equivalent. This requirement may be relaxed in the future depending on regulatory feedback.


You can refer to this [process guide](./process-guides/caMicro-ProcessGuide) or [3-minute video](https://vimeo.com/843982034) to learn about the annotation process. For more information about the project, please refer to our wiki pages [What is HTT?](./whatIsHTT) and [Publications](./publications.md).

There are two types of training required to participate in the HTT pivotal study: knowledge-based training in the form of a CME course and interactive training, where annotations are collected for real images. [Click here](/training-2023.md) for an outline and instructions for the required training.


Once the training requirements are satisfied, participants will be assigned pivotal study collections (30-60 min per collection) according to their interest and availability. We value your time. You can get help, ask questions, or provide feedback by [emailing project organizers](/team.md). Please be patient with us responding.

### More Information about the Project

- You can refer to this [process guide](./process-guides/caMicro-ProcessGuide.md) or [3-minute video](https://vimeo.com/843982034) to learn about the annotation process. 

- Be sure to read the [informed consent document](./pivotal-study/pdfs-images/HTT_IRBinformedConsent.pdf).  Although signatures are not required due to the study's minimal risk IRB exemption status, it is still an important document outlining your participation.
