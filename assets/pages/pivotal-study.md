Thank you for your interest in the HTT pivotal study. We are **recruiting volunteers** to provide annotations of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) that will be used for validating artificial intelligence and machine learning models. You can refer to this [process guide](training-2023/pdfs/caMicro-ProcessGuide-20230821.pdf) or [3-minute video](https://vimeo.com/843982034) to learn about the annotation process. For more information about the project, please refer to our [publications page](/publications.md).


There are two types of training required to participate in the HTT pivotal study: knowledge-based training in the form of a CME course and interactive training, where annotations are collected for real images. [Click here](/training-2023.md) for an outline and instructions for the required training.


Once the training requirements are satisfied, participants will be assigned pivotal study collections (30-60 min per collection) according to their interest and availability. We value your time. You can get help, ask questions, or provide feedback by [emailing project organizers](/team.md). Please be patient with us responding.
