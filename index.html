subtitle: FDA DIDSR validation dataset creation for ML algorithm development.

[TBD] The HTT project aims to create a validation dataset established by pathologist annotations for artificial intelligence
algorithms analyzing digital scans of pathology slides: data (images + annotations). We are pursuing the qualification
of the final validation dataset as an FDA-qualified medical device development tool MDDT to become a high-value public
resource that can be used in AI/ML algorithm submissions and guide others to develop quality validation datasets.
