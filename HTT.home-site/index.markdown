    <h1>{{ "High Throughput Truthing Project" | upcase }}</h1>
 The HTT project aims to create a validation dataset established by pathologist annotations for artificial intelligence algorithms analyzing digital scans of pathology slides: data (images + annotations). We are pursuing the qualification of the final validation dataset as an FDA-qualified medical device development tool MDDT to become a high-value public resource that can be used in AI/ML algorithm submissions and guide others to develop quality validation datasets.
