description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Blah blah blah... a project to create 
  a validation dataset established by pathologist annotations for artificial 
  intelligence algorithms analyzing digital scans of pathology slides: 
  data (images + annotations). We are pursuing the qualification of the 
  final validation dataset as an FDA-qualified medical device development 
  tool MDDT to become a high-value public resource that can be used in AI/ML 
  algorithm submissions and guide others to develop quality validation 
  datasets.
