We have gotten a huge response from interested pathologists.  Please if you haven't already, share our [flyer](../assets/pages/process-guides/pdfs-images/recruitReadersFlyer-2023.pdf) with your networks!

* We've been making considerable updates to [CaMicroscope](https://wolf.cci.emory.edu/camic/htt/login.html)! Gone are the struggles on pFDA, so if you're interested in trying out our new modules or selecting some ROIs, let us know.

* Thoughts on offering co-authorship opportunities to Study participants? We are considering employing a Delphi method to do so, but would like this group's opinions.
