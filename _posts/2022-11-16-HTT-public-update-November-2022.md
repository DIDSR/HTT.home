## September 2022

* Personal Celebrations! Project managers Victor Garcia, and Kate Elfer celebrated their weddings to their significant others!



## August 2022

* Slides for our pivotal study have been received from Emory University and Stony Brook University and scanned with an Aperio AT2 DX (FDA-qualified WSI scanner)

* Brandon Gallas presented to the Pathology Innovation Collaborative Community a Webinar on “ROC and MRMC Tutorials”

    * [Link to Recordings, Slides, and Abstract - legacy](https://ncihub.org/groups/eedapstudies/wiki/Presentation2022:PathologyInnovationCollaborativeCommunityWebinarROCandMRMCTutorialsGallas)

* Brandon Gallas and Si Wen presented their work at the Joint Statistical Meeting:

    * Brandon Gallas, “Exploring Pathologist-Pathologist Agreement as a Baseline for Algorithm-Pathologist Agreement”
    
    * Si Wen, “Limits of Agreement for an MRMC Study”



## July 2022

* Info Sharing: One day, the public health emergency will be declared over. Here is guidance on what happens to devices that fall within pandemic enforcement policies, like WSI scanners: [LINK](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/transition-plan-medical-devices-fall-within-enforcement-policies-issued-during-coronavirus-disease)

* Open-Position: ORISE Fellow

    * Victor Garcia, MD, is transitioning into an FDA/CDRH/DIDSR full-time staff fellow
    
    * We therefore have an open ORISE Fellow position for the next year (starting 01 October 2022): Statistics and Informatics Support the Assessment of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
    
    * Actively recruiting now – please distribute! [jobDescriptionDigitalPathologyAIML-20220617-2_1.pdf - legacy](https://ncihub.cancer.gov/groups/eedapstudies/wiki/HTTupdateCurrent/File:jobDescriptionDigitalPathologyAIML-20220617-2_1.pdf)

* **Needed:** We are looking for an FDA-cleared Scanner. We are targeting the the Aperio AT2 DX because it has a format that is open enough to be supported by several software tools and platforms.

    * One batch of pivotal study slides are in our hands!

* Upcoming Presentations: American Statistical Association’s Joint Statistical Meeting

    * Session: Assessing Agreement and Reader Reliability in Medical Imaging Analysis (organized by Si Wen)
    
    * August 7th, 2022 in Washington DC
Link to Session Info

    * Brandon will present “Exploring Pathologist-Pathologist Agreement as a Baseline for Algorithm-Pathologist Agreement”

    * Si will present “Limits of Agreement for an MRMC Study”

    * *We hope to schedule a redux of the session to be hosted by PIcc.*
