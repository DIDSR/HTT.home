## How to build site locally
- clone repo locally  
- have ruby installed (I have version 3.2.0)  
    - I have it installed in ""C:\Users\Emma.Gardecki\.local\share\gem\ruby\"  
    - install jekyll and bundler gems using command `gem install bundler jekyll` which will also install many dependent gems  
- local deployment command: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
